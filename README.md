## Overview

### Description

Schedl is a social calendar application that blends traditional calendar apps with a social aspect by allowing you to create individual or collaborative events where you can invite your friends or other users on the app. Within Schedl, friends will be able to view each other's schedules and events (based on what each user decides to show/hide). A big feature of Schedl allows for users to create 'Blends' with their friends so that they can view each other's schedules all under one and can then generate meeting times based on this or even just decide on a time for all of them to meet. When a user creates an event in a Blend, the invite is immediately added to all user's schedules given that the time slot is free. Lastly, the biggest feature of Schedl allows for users to create posts based on their events. If a user decides they want to share a photo during or after an event, they can simply go to create a post and can then pick from their most recent events to create a post based on it. This post will then be visible to only their friends. The idea of Schedl is not to go viral or gain tons of followers; it's purpose is to allow users to have a place where they can easily relate and recall their memories by viewing past events and seeing their uploaded photos.
